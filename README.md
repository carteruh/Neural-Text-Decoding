# Neural-Text-Decoding
Text model training for the paper "A high-performance neuroprosthesis for speech decoding and avatar control"
To understand my work, I have uploaded a new dataset from the following paper: "A High Performance Speech Neuroprosthesis". I have preprocessed, padded, and normalized neural data from another BCI study to fit within the training code of the original paper "A high-performance neuroprosthesis for speech decoding and avatar control". I use a Flexible CNN RNN classifier to predict the phoneme probabilities and use a CTC decoder loaded with a 3-gram language model to predict the most likely words from neural signals on the 6v channel. The data was recorded from 4 invasive microelectrode arrays implanted in the Broca's area and ventral premotor cortex that is associated with speech generation.
